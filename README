This webapp. is for seeing how CAS clients function.  It's useful for 
poking around in details that you normally want to ignore, when you want 
to find out e.g. what attributes are asserted for a given principal.  It 
gets a service ticket and then vomits out anything it can find inside, 
plus session and request information.

You'll need to configure the CAS filters for your local server and your 
CAS service.  One way is through the JNDI environment.  In Tomcat:

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<Context
    docBase='/home/mwood/NetBeansProjects/CAS-Explorer/target/CAS-Explorer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war'>
  <Environment description="Server Name"
               name="cas/serverName"
               override="false"
               type="java.lang.String"
               value="https://mhw.ulib.iupui.edu:8443"
               />
  <Environment description="CAS Login Url"
               name="cas/AuthenticationFilter/casServerLoginUrl"
               override="false"
               type="java.lang.String"
               value="https://cas.iu.edu/cas/login"/>
  <Environment description="CAS Url Prefix"
               name="cas/Cas20ProxyReceivingTicketValidationFilter/casServerUrlPrefix"
               override="false"
               type="java.lang.String"
               value="https://cas.iu.edu/cas"/>
</Context>

(Adjust 'docBase' and the 'value's as needed!)
